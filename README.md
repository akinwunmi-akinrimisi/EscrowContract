### **Escrow Smart Contract Development Task**

**Objective:**
Develop a decentralized escrow smart contract to facilitate secure transactions between a buyer and seller, with funds held by an escrow service provider. The contract should ensure that funds are only released when predefined conditions are met, with robust dispute resolution mechanisms and security features.

**Key Features and Requirements:**

1. **Roles and Participants:**
   - Define three roles: `Buyer`, `Seller`, and `Escrow Service Provider`.
   - Ensure that each participant has specific actions within the transaction workflow.

2. **Order Creation & Escrow Deposit:**
   - Implement a function that allows the `Buyer` to create an order and deposit the agreed payment amount into the escrow.
   - The escrow must hold the funds securely until conditions for release are met.

3. **Confirmation Mechanisms:**
   - Include functionality for the `Seller` to confirm that the goods or services have been delivered.
   - The `Buyer` must be able to confirm receipt and satisfaction with the goods/services.
   - Both confirmations should trigger the release of funds to the `Seller`.

4. **Dispute Resolution:**
   - Incorporate a dispute resolution mechanism, allowing either party to initiate a dispute if delivery is not confirmed or there is an issue with the transaction.
   - The `Escrow Service Provider` should act as an arbitrator and make the final decision on whether funds should be released or refunded.
   - Provide an optional third-party arbitration feature for external validation.

5. **Fund Release Conditions:**
   - Implement dual confirmation for fund release, ensuring that both the `Buyer` and `Seller` confirm their satisfaction before the funds are released.
   - Add the ability for partial fund releases if the transaction is divided into milestones or phases.
   - Include a time-based release option if no disputes are raised within a set period.

6. **Automatic Refund Mechanism:**
   - Set up a process for automatic refunds if the delivery is not confirmed by the `Buyer` or if the `Seller` does not fulfill the order within the agreed timeframe.

7. **Escrow Fees:**
   - Incorporate an escrow service fee, which can be taken from either the `Buyer`, `Seller`, or split between both parties.
   - The fee should be configurable and deducted from the total funds held in escrow.

8. **Customizable Conditions:**
   - Allow for customizable transaction conditions, including delivery milestones for larger projects, which can trigger partial fund releases.
   - Provide the option to involve a third-party validator to confirm delivery in addition to the `Buyer` and `Seller`.

9. **Status Tracking:**
   - Implement functions to track the status of each transaction (e.g., `Pending`, `Delivered`, `Confirmed`, `Disputed`, `Released`).
   - Allow both the `Buyer` and `Seller` to view the current status of their orders, including the amount of funds held in escrow.

10. **Time Limits and Expiration:**
   - Set time limits for both the `Buyer` and `Seller` to confirm their respective actions (e.g., delivery and receipt confirmation).
   - If the time limit expires without the required confirmations, escalate the transaction to dispute resolution or initiate an automatic refund.

11. **Events and Logging:**
   - Emit events for key contract actions (e.g., `OrderCreated`, `FundsDeposited`, `DeliveryConfirmed`, `FundsReleased`, `DisputeInitiated`).
   - Ensure all actions are logged and accessible for auditability and transparency.

12. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement security mechanisms, including isolation of escrowed funds, re-entrancy guard, and limiting the amount the escrow provider can withdraw at a time.
   - Integrate mechanisms to protect the contract from external exploits.

13. **Emergency Exit:**
   - Develop an emergency function allowing the escrow provider to pause the contract in the event of suspicious or emergency conditions.
   - Create a fallback mechanism allowing the provider or admin to handle emergency fund withdrawals in the case of system failure.

14. **Token Payment Support (Optional):**
   - Enable support for ERC20 token payments in addition to the native cryptocurrency.
   - Provide the ability to set exchange rates for various tokens if multiple tokens are supported.

15. **Multi-Sig Escrow Control (Optional):**
   - Integrate multi-signature control for the escrow provider to enhance security. Multiple signatures should be required before funds can be released or refunded.

16. **Participant Notifications:**
   - Add an alert and notification system to remind the `Buyer`, `Seller`, and `Escrow Provider` of pending actions (e.g., delivery confirmation or dispute initiation).

**Deliverables:**
- Fully functional escrow smart contract with all listed features.
- Comprehensive unit tests to verify the functionality of each feature.
- Clear and concise documentation explaining contract deployment, usage, and functions.
